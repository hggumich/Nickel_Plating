Trouble Shooting

A) Solution plated out.
Solution starts to plate its surroundings.
	1) Stop plating.
	2) Dump the solution. Continue plating will consume the chemistry. The nickel on the surrounding will plate faster than the parts.
	3) Remove ask much of the nickel plated out.
	4) Fill the tank with 25% nitric acid. Along the solution to dissolve the nickel for 8 - 24 hours.
	5) Rinse the tank.
	6) Fill the tank with 25% Ammonia Hydroxide. Neutralize the nitric acid. Nitric acid will unbalance the nickel in the solution.
	7) Rinse.
	8) Remake bath.

B) Hardness Fails

C) Hydrogen Embrittlement Fail

D) Low Plating Rate
