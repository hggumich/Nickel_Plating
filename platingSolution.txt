Plating Solutions

Product: Meta-Plate Ultima XT II

Comments: 
Solutions works on copper. The copper base needs to be strike with nickle using MSI's tank number CD8.
Qorvo 841193-06 needs 30 seconds plating at 30 ASF. Electroless nickel plating for copper requires special
treatment. Since copper is non-catalytic in comprasion to nickel, it needs the nickle strike. The nickle
strike facilites the process by applying an electrical current for a few seconds before beginning the
soaking in the electroless nickel solution. The nickel strike will promote catalytic sites.
