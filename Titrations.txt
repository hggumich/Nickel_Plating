Nickel Metal Analysis

Reagents:
	Concentrate ammonium hydroxide
	1 % murexide indicator w/CP grade sodium chloride
	EDTA (disodium dihydrate salt)
	0.1 molar = 37.235 g/L

Procedure: 
	1. Pipette 10 ml sample of EN working bath into a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask
	2. Add ~ 50 ml of DI water.
	3. Add 5 ml of concentrated ammonium hydroxide to form a light blue solution.
	4. Add a pinch of Murexide to form a light brown color solution.
	5. Titrate with std. 0.1 M EDTA to a violet purple (magenta) endpoint.
	6. Calculations:
		ml 0.1 M EDTA	x 0.078 = oz/gal Nickel metal
				x 0.587 = g/l Nickel metal

Note: 
	Optimum nickel concentration is 0.8 oz/gal.
		For every 0.1 oz/gal low of nickel metal, add 1.0 fl. oz/gal of META-PLATE ULTIMA XT II-A.


Hypophosphite Analysis

Reagents:
	6N Hydrochloric Acid (Dilute conc. HCl 50/50 with DI water)
	0.1N Iodine solution
	0.1N Sodium Thiosulfate solution

Procedure: 
	1. Pipette exactly 5 ml aliquot of room temp working bath into an Iodine glass flask.
	2. Add 50 ml DI H2O and 30 ml of 6N HCL.
	3. Exactly pipette 50 ml of 0.1 N Iodine Solution into the iodine flask.
	4. Stopper flask and swirl it to ensure mixing. Then put it in a dark place for at least 35 minutes.
	5. Remove stopper, rinse flask neck with DI water.
	6. Titrate immediately with 0.1N Sodium Thiosulfate solution to a clear endpoint.
	7. Calculations: 
		[ (ml 0.1N iodine) – (ml 0.1N sodium Thiosulfate) ] x 0.141 = oz/gal sodium hypophosphite
		[ (ml 0.1N iodine) – (ml 0.1N sodium Thiosulfate) ] x 1.06 = g/l sodium hypophosphite

Note:
	Optimum concentration is 4.0 oz/gal
		For every 0.1 oz/gal of Sodium Hypophosphite low, add 0.20 oz/gal META-PLATE ULTIMA XT II-C.


pH Control

To raise and maintain pH for normal operation, adjustments should be made with 50 %
Ammonium Hydroxide or 2 lbs/gal. Potassium Carbonate. To lower pH, if necessary,
add 25 % reagent grade Sulfuric Acid. Make all additions slowly, with agitation, and
preferably without work in the tank.


Replenishment Chart
For optimum results, bath replenishment should be maintained by nickel metal analysis.
Recommended nickel concentration is 0.8 oz/gal. META-PLATE ULTIMA XT II-A
and META-PLATE ULTIMA XT II-C added at a 1:1 ratio.
